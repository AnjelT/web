    <p id="about">Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know of so far 
        that’s <br>  inhabited by living things. 
        While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is <br> the only world in our 
        solar system with liquid water on the surface. Just slightly larger than nearby  <br> Venus,
        Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal. <br> 
        The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets, except for Earth, were n
        amed after Greek  <br>  and Roman gods and goddesses. However, the name Earth is a Germanic word, 
        which simply means “the ground.”</p>

                    <h2>Water:</h2>
                    Water is an inorganic, transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly 
                    colorless chemical substance, which is the main constituent of Earth's 
                    hydrosphere and the fluids of all known living organisms (in which it 
                    acts as a solvent).  Its chemical 
                    formula is H2O, meaning that each of its molecules contains one 
                    oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, connected by covalent bonds. 
                    Two hydrogen atoms are attached to one oxygen atom at an angle of 104.45°.

                    <h2>Air:</h2>
                    Air is all around us, but we can’t see it. So what is air, exactly? 
                    It’s a mixture of different gases. The air in Earth’s atmosphere is made up 
                    of approximately 78 percent nitrogen and 21 percent oxygen. Air also has small 
                    amounts of lots of other gases,
                    too, such as carbon dioxide, neon, and hydrogen.
                    While air is mostly gas, it also holds lots of tiny particles. These particles in the air 
                    are called aerosols. Some aerosols—like dust and pollen—are picked up naturally when the 
                    wind blows. But the air can also carry soot, smoke, and other particles from car exhaust 
                    and power plants. 
                    These are major contributors to air pollution.
                    People need to breathe, and so do lots of other animals—and plants! Breathing is part of 
                    a process called respiration. During respiration, a living thing takes in oxygen from the 
                    air and gives out carbon dioxide. This process gives animals and plants 
                    the energy to eat, grow, and live life!

                    Safe environment means that a client is able to remain in the client’s current living 
                    situation and negotiate the living environment independently with limited supports to 
                    gain access to groceries, medications, medical appointments, and transportation and 
                    with limited assistance with personal care.
